Below are my definitions of an object and a class.

Object: An object is the basic unit that represents real live things. Simply put they are the instance of a class. meaning they are used to define certain things. In example an object can be: dog, with a name (identity), breed (attribute), Bark (Behavior).

Class: This is a set of objects that share some common characteristics or properties. Meaning they are supposed to act like a blueprint from which one can create objects to define certain aspects as described above. So, in example, a student can be a class. But then the object would define one student to be Mahavir that is 6ft tall with a loud voice.

Thus, the main difference between classes and objects, is that a class is like a template for creating objects with shared attributes and behaviors (like exampled above). While objects are the actual physical tangible instance that actually adhere to the structure and behaviors defined in the referenced classes. This allows for easier object oriented programming instead of having to define all data areas needed. Thus, this blueprint like class can be very useful when programming in Java.
